# Privacy Policy for Alexa Payment Notification Skill

*Last Updated:* 11-13-2024

## 1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how *Mohak Agarwal* ("I", "me", "my") collects, uses, and shares information when you use my Alexa Payment Notification Skill (the "Skill").

This Skill is created solely for personal use to manage payment notifications and is not intended for public use. However, I respect your privacy and am committed to protecting it.

## 2. Information Collection and Use
The Skill does not collect any personal information from users. No data, such as payment details, user names, or addresses, is stored or transmitted to any third parties. The Skill only processes the information provided by Amazon Alexa to generate notifications.

### Data Handling
The Skill only functions within the scope of Alexa’s functionality and does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data beyond what is necessary to perform the requested tasks, such as reading aloud payment notifications.

## 3. Data Security
While this Skill does not store or process any sensitive information, any data transmitted between Amazon Alexa and the Skill is secured according to Amazon's Alexa Skills Kit policies and security standards.

## 4. Third-Party Services
This Skill uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda for backend processing. AWS follows strict data security protocols. No data is stored on AWS servers once the Skill’s tasks are completed.

## 5. User Control and Choice
Since the Skill does not collect or store any personal data, there are no user accounts or personal data to delete. Users can disable the Skill at any time through their Alexa app if they no longer wish to use it.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this GitHub page, and the updated date will reflect any revisions.

## 7. Contact Information
